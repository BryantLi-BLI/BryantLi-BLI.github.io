Presented findings on catalytic ammonia production on Fe–Ni alloy clusters (Awaruite and Tetrataenite) as a mechanism relevant to the origins of life in the Archean Era. Classical potentials (Finnis–Sinclair, Lennard–Jones, Sutton–Chen) were used to model cluster thermodynamic stability and predict adsorption behavior of nitrogen and hydrogen species.
