We present a generalized computational framework for studying solid-state reaction interfaces using machine-learned interatomic potentials. The approach is applied to a range of technologically relevant interfaces in solid-state batteries, providing atomistic insight into reaction mechanisms, interface stability, and ion transport that is inaccessible to purely DFT-based methods.
