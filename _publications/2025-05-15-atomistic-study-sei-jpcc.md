We employ machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation at the Li metal/Li₇P₃S₁₁ interface. By sampling reactive trajectories beyond the reach of ab initio methods, we identify key decomposition products, interfacial reaction mechanisms, and the thermodynamic driving forces governing SEI growth in sulfide-based solid-state batteries.
