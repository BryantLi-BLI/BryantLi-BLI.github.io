Atomate2 is a modern, modular workflow library for high-throughput computational materials science. It provides automated workflows for DFT calculations, machine learning potential training, and multi-fidelity simulations. This paper describes the architecture, design principles, and community-contributed workflows now adopted across multiple research groups.
